In this question there are 4 different events such as:
1. Boy    Boy
2. Boy    Girl
3. Girl   Boy
4. Girl   Girl

Actually, I did some research and I found that is a paradox that formulated by Martin Gardner.

I think that I have 3 events in my sample set and the probability of both of them are boys is 1/3.
