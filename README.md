10 Days of Statistics Challenge in HackerRank

Nowadays, I started to a little and simple re-rememeber camp for me. I studied databases etc. Also, I started to wander in HackerRank again.

I am planning to complete skill practices. And I found this challenge, daily statistics coding, I think the best definition for this challenge! 

So, I will work on this challenge daily. I chose Java language nearly unwittingly. So, I started with Java and probably continue with it.
