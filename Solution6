In this tasks, I want to calculate single tossed 2-dices' probability that their sum AT MOST 9.

I planned to find probability that their sum bigger than 9, after that I would extract it from 1 and I would find the result.

Our events are:
E = {(4,6) (5,6) (6,6) (6,6) (6,4) (6,5)}

P(E) = 6 * (1/6 * 1/6) = 6/36

Result = 1 - P(E) = 1 - 6/36 = 30/36 = 5/6
